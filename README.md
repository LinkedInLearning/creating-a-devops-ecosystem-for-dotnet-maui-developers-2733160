# Creating a DevOps Ecosystem for .NET Maui Developers
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Creating a DevOps Ecosystem for .NET Maui Developers. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Course Description

The DevOps ecosystem is a core piece required to develop mobile applications quickly and to control quality. MAUI was never tied into the Microsoft AppCenter, but with the retirement of AppCenter, we can see why this choice was made. In this course, Kevin Ford—an independent machine learning and mobile consultant—explains in detail how MAUI developers can set up a DevOps pipeline without relying on AppCenter. From build to testing and deployment, dive into a wide variety of DevOps processes that you can use in your MAUI applications. This course prepares you to create and customize a DevOps ecosystem that is specific to your needs.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
